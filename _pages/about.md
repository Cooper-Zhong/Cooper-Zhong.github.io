I am Zhiyuan Zhong, a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). I am also doing research in [Software Quality Lab](https://sqlab-sustech.github.io/), supervised by Prof. [Yepang Liu](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~liuyp/).

<!-- name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

My current research is on Software Engineering, specifically LLM4SE. I am exploring the application of Large Language Models in discovering potential bugs within libraries. I am also very interested in research fields inlcuding Natural Language Processing, trustworthiness & safety of Large Language Models.
