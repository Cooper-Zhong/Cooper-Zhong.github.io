Our latest work on fuzzing *fastjson2* is submitted to ASE 2024 (Industry Showcase). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to fuzz [fastjson2](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson2), a JSON library from Alibaba. Based on unit tests, we utilize LLMs to generate diverse test cases by incorporating JSON-specific mutation rules. While manual inspection reveals that LLM-generated tests can be erroneous with self-contradictory assertions, we demonstrate that LLMs have the potential for classifying false-positive test failures. As of the end of June 2024, we have identified **34** bugs in *fastjson2* , with **30** of them already fixed. The full list of bugs can be found [here](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson2/issues?q=author:Cooper-Zhong).
